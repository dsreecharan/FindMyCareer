# FindMyCareer Project Details

## Project Overview
The FindMyCareer project is designed to help users discover career paths that align with their personality traits. It involves a personality test that evaluates users' preferences and provides career recommendations based on their scores.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - macOS
   - MongoDB
   - Node.js
   - npm

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up environment variables using the provided `.env.example` files for both the server and the Next.js application.

3. **Running the Project**:
   - Use the `start.sh` script to start both the backend and frontend applications.
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible.

## Scripts
### start.sh
- Starts the backend and frontend servers.
- Checks MongoDB status and opens the application in a browser.

### stop.sh
- Stops the backend and frontend servers.
- Optionally stops MongoDB with user confirmation.

## Database Structure
- **Questions**: Each question has multiple options with scores for analytical, creative, social, and structured traits.
- **Test Results**: Stores user responses, scores, and recommended careers.

## Code Changes and Fixes
- Updated the TestResult model to use `structured` consistently.
- Fixed the question controller to use `structured` instead of `practical`.
- Created properly structured questions in the database.
- Added error handling in the frontend to prevent "NaN%" from displaying.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure MongoDB is running if the application fails to connect.
- Check for port conflicts if servers do not start.
- Verify environment variables are correctly set.

## Additional Notes
